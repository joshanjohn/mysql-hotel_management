# mysql-hotel_management

“ HOTEL MANAGEMENT “ is a useful project, it is very essential to track all records in a hotel. Our program helps in a better and easier way of establishing connection between database and raw data. It helps the administration to store credentials. The program can be accessed only with username and password in order to prevent unauthorized access.


This project is an implementation of connectivity between MySQL database and Python an high-level and general-purpose programming language.
Though our program user can access a database with two table’s namely “menu” and “booking”, both are MySQL database table’s. Users can store numbers and lists of items with the amount of respective, in their restaurant. In the same way in “booking” users can store booking information such as booking number, booking name, booking address, phone number, Email, date of booking and respective booking classes.

This system will indeed help the hotel management and the esteemed staff members to manage and steer the hotel’s restaurant and hotel bookings to realize its maximum potential in addition to its competence in the hotel business field

# OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

The objective of this project is to let the students apply the programming knowledge into a real- world situation/problem and exposed
 the students how programming skills help in developing good software.


1) To learn how to design and program Python applications.

2) Write programs utilizing modern software tools.

3) Write effective procedural code to solve small to medium-sized problems.

4) To define the structure and components of a Python program.

5) Students will demonstrate a breadth of knowledge in computer science, as exemplified in the areas of systems, theory and software development.

6) Students will demonstrate ability to conduct a research or applied Computer Science project, requiring writing and presentation skills which exemplify scholarly style in computer science.

# SOURCE  CODE
We have divided the codes into files as modules For every operation in the Table menu and booking .we keep a good track of our codes and for their reusability. Grouping related codes into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.
To run the entire program, open the index.py file.
